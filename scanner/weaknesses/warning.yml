  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Found object deserialization using ObjectInputStream. Deserializing entire
    Java objects is dangerous because malicious actors can create Java object
    streams with unintended consequences. Ensure that the objects being
    deserialized are not user-controlled. Consider using HMACs to sign the
    data stream to make sure it is not tampered with, or consider only 
    transmitting object fields and populating a new object.
